# üëΩ Marvel
For best practices: Clean Architecture, Multi Modules, Hilt, MVVM, Coroutines with migrating a View-based app to Jetpack Compose.

## üèÉ How to run the project
1. You should get an API Key. (https://developer.marvel.com/)
2. Save the base url and your keys (public & private key) in your `local.properties`.
```
MARVEL_BASE_URL = "https://gateway.marvel.com:443/v1/public/"
MARVEL_PUBLIC_KEY = [YOUR PUBLIC KEY]
MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY = [YOUR PRIVATE KEY]
```
3. Build and run the project

## üèõ Architecture
### Clean Architecture

The application consists of 3 layers.

1. **Presentation Layer** <br/>
    - `view` : Displays the application data on the screen (Activity/Fragment)
    - `viewmodel` : Stores UI related data and interacts with the domain layer.
2. **Domain Layer** <br/>
  Contains the **business logic** of the application. <br/>
  It's an individual module and complete java/kotlin module. <br/> 
  The domain layer is responsible for encapsulating complex business logic, or simple business logic that is reused by multiple ViewModels.
    - `usecase` : Contains the business logic of the application.
    - `repository interface`
    - `model` (domain) : Represents the domain-specific objects or entities.
3. **Data Layer** <br/>
   Handles data retrieval, storage, and mapping.
    - `datasource` : Represents the source of data, such as a network API or a local DB responsible for data retrieval and storage.
    - `repository impl` : Implements the repository interface in the domain layer.
    - `mapper` : Converts data model to domain model.
    - `model` (dto) : Represents the data structure or objects used within the data layer.

### Modularization & dependencies

</p>
 
  - `app` : Serves as an entry point to the application.
  - `feature` : Contains an isolated part of an app's functionality.
  - `common-ui` : Contains custom UI elements that helps make UI consistent across different features.
  - `domain` : Encapsulates the business logic of the application.
  - `data` : Contains a repository, data sources and model classes.


## ‚öí Tech Stack
- `Clean Architecture` + `Multi Module` + `MVVM`
- Migrate from a View-based app to `Compose`.
- `Coroutines` `Flow` : Asynchronous
- `ViewModel` `ViewBinding` `Navigation` `Compose` : Jetpack
- `Hilt` : Dependency Injection
- `Retrofit` : Network
- `Glide` : Image Library
